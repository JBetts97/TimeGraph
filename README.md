**What is TimeGraph for?** <br>
Have you ever needed to book a virtual meeting with somebody from outside your timezone, and you want to find a time which would best suit everyone? TimeGraph lets you easily identify a time that suits all timezones, and then copy the times to clipboard ready to paste into an email or calendar. <br> <br>
**How is it built?** <br>
TimeGraph is built using the following frameworks and tools:
- [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

## Contributing
Contributions are highly encouraged, no matter how big or small. <br>
Refer to `CONTRIBUTING.md` for more details. <br> <br>
Xcode requires you to have a Mac meaning unfortunately code contributions will require a mac. You can still contribute to our documentation if you don't have a mac! <br>

To setup the local environment simply:
1. Ensure you have xcode installed. <br>

2. Clone the repository: <br>
`git clone https://github.com/JBetts97/TimeGraph.git`

3. Run the `TimeGraph.xcodeproj` file which will initiate the xcode developer environment.
